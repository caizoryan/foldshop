- [ ] Properties -> {} type function 
  > where it will parse postion, or x y and make accessible as ui
  > hotkeys to rotate and scale...

- [ ] Symbol renders to be able to change their values (number can have sliders and stuff)

 > getref()
 > getcurrentref -> getref(location)
 > getparent (ref, index)
 > getfirstsymbol (location)
- [ ] use transcation based mutation for array... to get undo redo and recordable macros
